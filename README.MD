# Image to ASCII Art Converter

This Python script converts images to ASCII art. ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses printable characters from the ASCII standard to create images. This tool takes an input image, processes it to reduce its color complexity, and maps each pixel to a corresponding ASCII character based on its brightness. The result is a text representation of the image that resembles the original when viewed from a distance.

## Example

#### Image

<img src="fcb.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="300">

#### ASCII Art

<img src="example-screeshot.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="300">
